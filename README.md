# 🌌 ResonanceSky — Solar Path & Cone Mosaic Simulation

**ResonanceSky** is an interactive browser-based simulation that visualizes the sky as if it were generated by resonance and interference fields.  
It models the **Sun’s real solar path**, layered interference patterns, and an **ocular cone mosaic** (tens of thousands of simulated photoreceptors per eye).  

The purpose is to explore how harmonics, perception, and optics could combine to generate a sky-like view, blending physics with visual neuroscience.

⚠️ Note: This simulation generates dynamic interference patterns. While not harmful under normal use, some users may experience visual discomfort if viewing for extended periods.

## ✨ Features

- **Solar Path Modes**
  - *Manual*: Adjust Sun azimuth & elevation directly.
  - *Earth-Solar*: Enter latitude, day of year, and time of day to track the real solar motion.
  - Physical solar disk (~0.53° diameter) included.

- **Resonance Field Models**
  - Plane waves (M modes)
  - Gabor bundle (K kernels)
  - Adjustable seed, dual-source offset, weighting, spectrum type.

- **Observer / Eye**
  - Stereo vision (two eyes, adjustable baseline)
  - Adjustable pupil size, defocus, chromatic aberration
  - Toggleable cone responses (S, M, L photoreceptors)

- **Retina & Foveation**
  - Adjustable fovea radius and feathering
  - Temporal blending (EMA)
  - Cone mosaic simulation (0.25× = ~32k cones/eye; 0.5× = ~130k/eye)

- **Export**
  - Save current sky as PNG
  - Shuffle random seed
  - Enable timelapse mode for periodic auto-exports

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1 — Local Browser
1. Download **`ResonanceSky.html`**
2. Double-click or open in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3. Use the left control panel to adjust simulation parameters.

### Option 2 — Local Web Server (recommended for timelapse & stability)
```bash
# Run a local server (Python example)
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then open [http://localhost:8080/ResonanceSky.html](http://localhost:8080/ResonanceSky.html)

## 🌌 Notes

- This simulation is **exploratory** and **illustrative**. It demonstrates how resonance-based interference fields could map into visual perception models.
- It does not use real astrophysical catalogs — skies are synthetic.
- Designed for conceptual exploration

## Safety Notice

⚠️ **Visual Patterns Disclaimer**  
This simulation generates dynamic interference patterns.  
While safe under normal use, some individuals may experience mild visual discomfort if viewed for extended periods.  
It is recommended to take breaks and avoid prolonged continuous viewing.
