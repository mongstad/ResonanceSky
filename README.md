# 🌌 ResonanceSky v0.7a — Solar Path & Cone Mosaic Simulation

**ResonanceSky** is an interactive browser-based simulation that visualizes the sky as if it were generated by resonance and interference fields.  
It models the **Sun’s real solar path**, layered interference patterns, and an **ocular cone mosaic** (tens of thousands of simulated photoreceptors per eye).  

The purpose is to explore how harmonics, perception, and optics could combine to generate a sky-like view, blending physics with visual neuroscience.

## ✨ Features

- **Solar Path Modes**
  - *Manual*: Adjust Sun azimuth & elevation directly.
  - *Earth-Solar*: Enter latitude, day of year, and time of day to track the real solar motion.
  - Physical solar disk (~0.53° diameter) included.

- **Resonance Field Models**
  - Plane waves (M modes)
  - Gabor bundle (K kernels)
  - Adjustable seed, dual-source offset, weighting, spectrum type.

- **Observer / Eye**
  - Stereo vision (two eyes, adjustable baseline)
  - Adjustable pupil size, defocus, chromatic aberration
  - Toggleable cone responses (S, M, L photoreceptors)

- **Retina & Foveation**
  - Adjustable fovea radius and feathering
  - Temporal blending (EMA)
  - Cone mosaic simulation (0.25× = ~32k cones/eye; 0.5× = ~130k/eye)

- **Export**
  - Save current sky as PNG
  - Shuffle random seed
  - Enable timelapse mode for periodic auto-exports

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1 — Local Browser
1. Download **`ResonanceSky v0.7a.html`**
2. Double-click or open in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3. Use the left control panel to adjust simulation parameters.

### Option 2 — Local Web Server (recommended for timelapse & stability)
```bash
# Run a local server (Python example)
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then open [http://localhost:8080/ResonanceSky%20v0.7a.html](http://localhost:8080/ResonanceSky%20v0.7a.html)

## 🌌 Notes

- This simulation is **exploratory** and **illustrative**. It demonstrates how resonance-based interference fields could map into visual perception models.
- It does not use real astrophysical catalogs — skies are synthetic.
- Designed for conceptual exploration
